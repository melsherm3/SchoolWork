		<h1>About Richie</h1>
		<p>Richie is known in triathlon for his passion, work ethic, and strong opinions about the state of the sport. His great love for the sport has enabled him to still compete as a pro in his 40's. After 
				20 years, he still loves training and racing. He's been self-coached for the past 15 years and starting coaching others in 2008 when a friend asked him to train him for his first Ironman. 
				After a successful debut, his first athlete, Trav Hill raced a few other ironmans on his own but didn't see the success he was looking for. Richie coached him again in 2014,
				where he PR'ed by 10 minutes in the Boulder Ironman (at altitude) and qualified for the Ironman World Championships.</p>
					
		<p>Richie is best known for his pro triathlon career where he collected 15 70.3 wins, 50 top three finishes, a world title in the team relay triathlon, and two podium and two 5th place finishes at the 
			70.3 world championships. Before that, Richie always knew he wanted to make a living in sport. In grade school, he put his passion into tennis, hoping to make it a career someday. As he grew older,
			he became successful in Australian football and running. After chasing around his father who trained for marathons, he completed his first marathon at age 14. He was picked for the Australian 
			national football team at 17, a spot he gave up to join the Army. A few years after leaving the Army, he took up triathlon and found a great passion for it.</p>
			
			<p>Starting out as a pro in triathlon wasn't easy. He often scraped by, picking up odd jobs when he ran out of money. After making a small name for himself, German Lothar Leder invited him to move to
			Germany and join the team he was on. With $800 to his name and no knowledge of the German language, Richie accepted and moved out to Germany. While there, he'd race almost every weekend, sometimes multiple
			times in order to make a living. He likes to boast that his record is 18 races in 15 weeks. He spent 10 years racing paycheck to paycheck and dividing his time between Germany and Australia.</p>
			
			<p>Toward the end of his stint in Germany, he would occasionally travel to the United States to compete in the LifeTime Fitness Series and the new 70.3 series that was just starting to grow. In 2006 he travelled
			to Boston to race the LifeTime Fitness race there. The race that year was cancelled due to a hurricane, but it was there that he met his future wife, Melissa. After being dragged along to run a 25K road race with
			her instead, he managed to impress her by attacking the post-race display of chocolate chip cookies with great enthusiasm. </p>
			
			<p>Richie soon moved to Boston and has spent the remainder of his career based out of the United States. He lived and trained in Boston and Austin for two years each and now lives in Boulder, CO with Melissa and their
			two dogs. He has experienced what it takes to come back from injury after breaking his pelvis and two years later his elbow. He also is intimately familiar with training through winter and what it takes to become
			a successful pro triathlete. As a coach, he excels in reading his athletes and making adjustments to their training based on their strengths, weaknesses, and work schedule. His training style is more traditional, 
			so if you are interested in training based off of stats and data, he's not the coach for you, but he'd be happy to recommend someone. Richie is most interested in teaching	athletes to pay attention to their bodies 
			and become less dependant on data, heart-rate monitors, and power meters. </p>
